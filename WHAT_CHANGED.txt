# WHAT CHANGED IN v2.0

## Summary
This is the enhanced version of your Building Carbon Analyzer with 4 major new features.
**Everything else remains exactly the same** - same models, same data, same accuracy.

## What's NEW:

### 1. 🏠 Landing Page
- Professional introduction page on startup
- Metrics display (89.4% accuracy, 3,500 buildings, <1 sec)
- Feature cards explaining capabilities
- Who it's for (ESG consultants, building owners, asset managers)
- "Get Started" buttons to different sections

**Why it matters:** Shows product thinking, not just ML skills

### 2. 📖 How to Use Guide
- Complete user documentation built into the app
- Expandable sections for each feature
- Quick start guide (5-minute demo)
- Best practices for consultants
- CSV upload instructions
- Troubleshooting tips

**Why it matters:** Professional tools need documentation

### 3. 📊 CSV Portfolio Upload
- Upload entire building portfolios at once (10-50+ buildings)
- Downloadable CSV template
- Automatic validation of column names
- Batch analysis in seconds
- All buildings added to portfolio for comparison

**Why it matters:** Consultants don't analyze one building at a time. They have Excel files with dozens of buildings. This is the #1 most practical feature.

### 4. ⚖️ Scenario Comparison
- Compare 3 different improvement strategies side-by-side
- Pre-configured scenarios: Solar, HVAC, Insulation, LED, Combined strategies
- See emissions reduction, cost, payback, ROI, LEED credits for each
- Visual comparison charts
- Helps build business cases for clients

**Why it matters:** Clients need options. "Should we do solar or HVAC?" This answers that question with data.

### 5. 🎨 Sidebar Navigation
- Cleaner UI with sidebar menu instead of tabs
- 7 pages: Home, Guide, Single Building, Portfolio, Scenarios, ROI, Analytics
- Professional navigation structure

## What DIDN'T Change:

✅ XGBoost model (still 89.4% accurate)
✅ Training data (still 3,500 buildings)
✅ LEED certification calculations
✅ PDF/Excel exports
✅ All existing features work exactly the same
✅ All .pkl files, data files unchanged

## Files Changed:

- **app.py** - REPLACED with enhanced version
- **portfolio_template.csv** - NEW file (example CSV for testing)
- **Everything else** - UNCHANGED

## Installation:

### Option 1: Replace Everything
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Longevity_CarbonPredictor

# Backup
cp app.py app_old.py

# Extract new files (replace app.py)
# Copy portfolio_template.csv

# Run
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 2: Keep Both Versions
```bash
# Run old version: streamlit run app_old.py
# Run new version: streamlit run app.py
```

## Testing the New Features:

1. **Landing Page** 
   - Start app → Should see professional intro page
   - Click sidebar buttons to navigate

2. **How to Use Guide**
   - Click "📖 How to Use" in sidebar
   - Explore expandable sections

3. **CSV Upload**
   - Click "📊 Portfolio Manager" in sidebar
   - Download template
   - Upload portfolio_template.csv
   - Click "Analyze Portfolio"
   - Should add 5 buildings

4. **Scenario Comparison**
   - Click "⚖️ Scenario Comparison" in sidebar
   - Input baseline building
   - Select 3 scenarios
   - Click "Compare Scenarios"
   - See side-by-side results

## Interview Demo Flow:

**30-second pitch:**
"I built an ML tool for ESG consultants. [Show landing page] It predicts carbon emissions 
with 89% accuracy, calculates LEED credits, includes CSV upload for portfolio analysis, 
and scenario comparison to evaluate different strategies."

**2-minute demo:**
1. Landing page (10 sec)
2. Single building analysis (40 sec)
3. CSV upload: "Consultants have Excel files with dozens of buildings" (30 sec)
4. Scenario comparison: "Compare solar vs HVAC vs combined" (40 sec)

## Troubleshooting:

**App won't start:**
- Check you're in the right directory
- Verify all .pkl files are present
- Try: `pip install fpdf2 openpyxl` if missing

**CSV upload fails:**
- Column names must match template exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check categorical values match allowed options

**Sidebar shows but pages blank:**
- Check for Python errors in terminal
- Verify app.py copied correctly

**Want to revert:**
```bash
cp app_old.py app.py
streamlit run app.py
```

## What to Tell Ryosuke:

"I enhanced the tool with 4 new features based on real consulting workflows:

1. **CSV Upload** - Because consultants analyze portfolios, not individual buildings
2. **Scenario Comparison** - To help build business cases with multiple options
3. **Landing Page & Guide** - Professional tools need documentation
4. **Sidebar Navigation** - Cleaner UX for complex applications

The core ML model is unchanged - still 89% accurate, still uses real emission factors and LEED calculations. I just made it more practical for actual consulting work."

## Resume Update:

**v2.0 Bullet Point:**
```
Built ML-powered building carbon analyzer for ESG consultants with LEED certification 
analysis, CSV portfolio upload, scenario comparison, and ROI modeling. XGBoost model 
(89% R²) trained on 3,500 buildings. Features landing page, user guide, and PDF report 
generation. Tech: Python, XGBoost, Streamlit, Plotly, FastAPI.
```
